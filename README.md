# AttritionIQ-Interactive-Workforce-Analytics-Dashboard

AttritionIQ – Interactive Workforce Analytics Dashboard

AttritionIQ is a fully interactive employee attrition and workforce analytics dashboard designed to uncover why employees leave, where attrition is concentrated, and which workforce segments are most at risk.

Built with a strong focus on data storytelling and decision support, the dashboard transforms raw HR data into actionable insights using dynamic filters, KPI cards, and rich visualizations.

The project enables HR teams and business leaders to:

Monitor overall attrition trends and workforce health

Identify high-risk departments, job roles, and education fields

Analyze job satisfaction patterns across age groups

Compare gender and marital status distributions

Drill down using interactive filters for deeper analysis

🧩 Why This Project Stands Out (This Matters)

Most dashboards just show charts.
This one:

Connects attrition + satisfaction + demographics

Encourages exploration, not passive viewing

Looks production-ready, not academic
